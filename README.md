# cs465-fullstack
In this project, I built a full stack web app with both a customer-facing Express site and an Angular-based admin SPA. Express served static pages using Handlebars, while Angular made the admin side dynamic and responsive.

I chose MongoDB for the backend because it stores data in JSON format, which worked well with the frontend and API. JSON tied the backend and frontend together, making data transfer simple and efficient.

Throughout the project, I refactored components for reuse—like separating the trip card into its own Angular component. This improved the app’s structure and made it easier to maintain.

Testing included using Postman to check API endpoints and handling security with JWT tokens. I protected sensitive routes and ensured that only logged-in users could make changes.

This course helped me grow as a full stack developer. I gained hands-on experience with APIs, authentication, frontend frameworks, and NoSQL databases. These skills are directly aligned with my career goals and make me more confident in applying for full stack roles.
